## üß† How It Works

1. **User Input**
   Users provide their:

   * Monthly Salary
   * Monthly Spending
   * Preferred Benefit (e.g., cashback, rewards)
   * And more...

2. **Filtering & Scoring**
   A custom engine filters and ranks credit cards based on:

   * Relevant spending categories (e.g., dining, travel, groceries)
   * Reward type match with user preference

3. **LLM Reasoning**
   A large language model via **Groq API** generates natural-language justifications for each recommendation.

4. **Reward Simulation**
   Calculates expected **annual cashback or reward points** based on spending and card-specific rates.

5. **WhatsApp Delivery**
   Sends the top credit card recommendations directly to the user's WhatsApp using **Twilio API**.
